# GETTING STARTED

## This is a simple plug and play theme.

# Run below code in your terminal

`ext install MikaelKraft.ivytag-theme`

# OR

* Go to extension section of your VScode, use the search bar and type `ivytag theme`. The first three letters will pop it up within a list
* The install will add ivytag theme to your Vscode software
* After install, Vscode will update it's color, simply click on `SET COLOR THEME`

## Get up and running straight away on Customizations

* Press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded.
* Open `File > Preferences > Color Themes` and pick your color theme.
* Open a file that has a language associated. The languages' configured grammar will tokenize the text and assign 'scopes' to the tokens. To examine these scopes, invoke the `Developer: Inspect Editor Tokens and Scopes` command from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac).

## Make changes

* Changes to the theme file are automatically applied to the Extension Development Host window.

## Adopt your theme to Visual Studio Code

* The token colorization is done based on standard TextMate themes. Colors are matched against one or more scopes.

To learn more about scopes and how they're used, check out the [color theme](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/color-theme) documentation.

## Install your extension

* To start using your extension with Visual Studio Code copy it into the `<user home>/.vscode/extensions` folder and restart Code.
* To share your extension with the world, read on https://code.visualstudio.com/docs about publishing an extension.
